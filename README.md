# Comparative Analysis of Two Historical Factor Model-Based Strategies in Rates Trading

**Overview 📖**
In this study, we evaluated two rate trading strategies: PCA butterfly trading and Cointegrated butterfly trading. Both strategies belong to the Historical Factor Model class and aim to identify mean-reverting stationary alpha factors and construct a replicating portfolio, typically referred to as butterfly spreads. We tested the stationarity, stability, and predictability of these two alpha factors (butterfly spreads) using empirical data from the past five years. Our study finds that the [3 YR, 5 YR, 10 YR] butterfly spreads constructed based on the PCA model and Cointegration model are effective under market conditions in 2023, which appear to be relatively stable. The factors exhibit significant stationarity and mean-reversion against the unit root process and random walk process under a 95% confidence level, and both static and dynamic mean-reversion trading on the butterfly have hit rates above 50%. Additionally, the PC-Neutralized butterfly outperforms the cointegrated butterfly considerably.
